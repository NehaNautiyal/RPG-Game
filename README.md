## Overview

There are 4 atomic models in our history:
1. Dalton's Solid Sphere
2. Thomson's Plum Pudding
3. Rutherford's Nuclear Model 
4. Bohr's Planetary Model 

While there is a 5th atomic model, Schrodinger's Quantum Mechanical Model, these four are widely known for their discovery into the building blocks of matter.

In this game, you can choose an atomic model and an opponent to see which one disproves which.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## How it Works

Each atomic model has its own:
* health
* evidence points (will increment with every experiment)
* inconclusive data points (stays constant throughout)

To begin, click on any atomic model.
Click on a second atomic model to disprove. 
When you click on ```Data Collection```, the health decreases for each atomic model, depending on the evidence points (for the original chosen atomic model) and the inconclusive data points (for the second chosen atomic model).
Continue pressing on ```Data Collection```
If the original chosen atomic model is able to ```disprove``` the other atomic models without losing all its health, you win! 

May your experiment collect the best data possible!
